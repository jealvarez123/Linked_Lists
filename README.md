# Linked Lists

---

## Objective

Get started with linked lists!

Now that you are familiar with nodes, the next step is to actually use them to build something! Linking together nodes using their next property creates a singly linked list. Singly linked lists are extremely versatile and useful, while also beautiful in their simplicity. Like nodes, these lists are used as foundations for future data structures and are an alternative to arrays when trying to store information in a linear way.

## Technologies used
